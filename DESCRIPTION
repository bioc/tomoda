Description: This package provides many easy-to-use methods to analyze and 
	visualize tomo-seq data. The main purpose of the package is to find zones
	with similar transcriptional profiles and spatially expressed genes in a 
	tomo-seq sample. Several visulization functions are available to create
	high quality and easy-to-modify plots.
