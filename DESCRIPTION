Description: This package provides many easy-to-use methods to analyze and 
	visualize tomo-seq data. The tomo-seq technique is based on cryosectioning 
	of tissue and performing RNA-seq on consecutive sections. (Reference: Kruse 
	F, Junker JP, van Oudenaarden A, Bakkers J. Tomo-seq: A method to obtain 
	genome-wide expression data with spatial resolution. Methods Cell Biol. 
	2016;135:299-307. doi:10.1016/bs.mcb.2016.01.006)
	The main purpose of the package is to find zones with similar 
	transcriptional profiles and spatially expressed genes in a tomo-seq sample.
	Several visulization functions are available to create easy-to-modify plots.
